<h1>Kentemere 200</h1>
<h2>The best general purpose film I've seen</h2>

<h3>The leadup</h3>
<div class="longtext">
<p>This film originally released on the summer of 2025 wich was unideal for me since I reserve that time for lower iso film <br> But nontheless the tought of nother readily avaliabe 200 iso film coming out was extremely exciting especially if it would mean not relying on foma 200 anymore.</p>
<p>Since the days are getting shorter now would be the perfect time to get some 200 film and damm I was right</p>
<h3>The shooting experience</h3>
<p>200 ISO is in my sweet spot for film sensitivity, it accommodates for more situations than 100 or 50 ISO film while still having a tight grain structure and the sense that I’m not wasting any of its sensitivity when shooting in brighter light.</p>
<p>which makes it even stranger to me how it’s a relative rarity among bw films, while color shooters are spoiled for choice with seemingly every new attempt at color film being ISO 200. Black and white shooters have historically had a very small set of options for them and other than Foma 200, which is Foma 200 the only other options were fringe films like Ilford sfx200 or  or  Rollei superpan 200 which is while I’m delighted about getting new options.</p>
<h3>Image quality</h3>

<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"> this image really shows the raw ammount of resolution you can get with kpan200</p>
<p>Kentemere pan 200 is much closer to its Ilford brothers than something like k pan 100. It exhibits very little grain and also the middling contrast or acutance that often describes something like the delta 100 but for a much lower cost. I prefer to develop it in compensating developer to bring forth the flexibility in terms of lighting you can achieve with 200
	It handles smooth even gray objects really well especially compared to its most direct competitor Foma 200 as well.</p>
<p>Kentemere pan 200 definetly has risen to my go to film stock thanks to this touhgt</p>

<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;"> somitmes 200 can be plenty appropiate for low light</p>

<p style="font-size: small; text-align: center;">in worse lighing conditon grain shines trough a bit more </p>
